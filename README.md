### Project Details

A small CLI project for fun and learning, integrating a bunch of free API's to get daily info fast. 
API's include:
- Chess.com api
- Cat Facts api
- Weatherstack api (needs key / signup)

A simple project aiming to learn how to deconstruct API responses and parse them into the CLI. You can easily replace and reiterate on the commonalities of the project to integrate your own free API's!

Anything the require a key you can use the weather.go file as reference and install the go env package and add your relevant `.env` files to your calls.

### TODO's
[ ] Tests (*mainly for api files*)
[ ] Further abstractions on case statement in main function
[ ] Create req and response function for handling calls to API in main function
